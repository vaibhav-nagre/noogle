My technical and project management skills, combined with my design-thinking approach, have enabled me to consistently exceed expectations and deliver impactful results.", "In every role, I’ve sought unique opportunities to rise above challenges and push the boundaries of what’s possible. At Arcurve, I pitched and developed a recruitment feature with the potential to become a critical data-collection asset. Currently, in Saviynt, I am working on the implementation process as well as fixing bugs in the product. I also have exposure to working with the backend architecture of microservices.
